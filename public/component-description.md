<!-- src/components/Animations/ImageLoader.tsx | Loading & Audio & Replaced Poem : 11.23.2024â€¢B -->

This is a React functional component named `ImageLoader`. It appears to be a complex animation component that loads an image, plays a whale sound, and displays a poem. Here's a succinct breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Image Loading**: The component loads an image from a specified `src` URL and displays a loading animation with a progress bar.
2. **Animation Sequence**: After the image is loaded, the component triggers an animation sequence that:
	* Waits for 500ms
	* Displays a poem overlay
	* Waits for 1000ms
	* Triggers a slide animation
	* Attempts to play a whale sound after the animation
3. **Whale Sound Playback**: The component uses the Web Audio API to play a whale sound. It creates an audio context, fetches and decodes the audio file, and plays it with a fade-in effect.
4. **Manual Play Button**: The component also includes a play button that allows the user to manually play the whale sound.
5. **Error Handling**: If there's an error loading the image or playing the sound, the component displays an error message.

The component uses several state variables to manage its behavior, including `isLoading`, `progress`, `showPoem`, `startSlideAnimation`, `hasError`, and `isPlaying`. It also uses several refs to store references to audio elements and nodes.
